Objective:

To predict sales and measure customer lifetime value for an e-commerce giant by analyzing large datasets using Python and data science libraries. 

Steps:

Predicted the sales for each week in a Walmart store. 

Used exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.

Performed regression analysis to predict the sales after one-hot encoding the requisite explanatory variables. 

Applied different models like ridge regression, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests, and extra tree regressors.

Next, predicted the customer lifetime value using regression analysis, and perform cross-validation and feature selection on the model in order to improve its performance. 

Finally, experimented with feature selection, including recursive feature elimination, lasso regularization, and linear SVR. 

Tools Used:

Python (pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook
